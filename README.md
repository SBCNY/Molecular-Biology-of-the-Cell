# Molecular-Biology-of-the-Cell Ontology (MBCO) - Executable Windows application
The folder "MBCO_windows_application" contains an excecutable windows application that allows scientists to analyze their data.
Simply copy that folder to any location on your hard drive and start the program by opening "Molecular_Biology_of_the_Cell_Ontology.exe".

This folder also contains <b><i><u>MBCO version 1.1</u></i></b> (that contains a reference for each pathway-gene association).<br>

<b><i><u>The last update of the application was uploaded on September 20, 2022.</u></i></b>

<i>Note: If your screen resolution is too high (e.g. 3840 x 2160) the current windows form will look compressed. In this case, lower your screen resolution (e.g. to 2560 x 1600) before opening the application. You can reset your screen resolution to the original value again, once the application started.</i>

# Additional MBCO datasets
This folder contains two ontologies that map genes to metabolic energy pathways as well as pathways involved in sodium and glucose transmembrane transport. They were both developed within the Kidney Precision Medicine Project (Hansen, Sealfon, Menon et al, Sci Adv. 2022).

#
The folders "MBCO_enrichment" and "MBCO_dataset" contain a C#-script and datasets that were uploaded in 2017. Both folders have no relevance for the windows application and can simply be ignored.
