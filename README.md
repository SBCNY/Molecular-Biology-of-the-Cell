# Molecular-Biology-of-the-Cell Ontology (MBCO) - Executable Windows application
To use the windows application, download the zip-folder by pressing the green 'Code'-button on the upper right side of this GitHub internet page. After unpacking of the downloaded folder, copy its subfolder "MBCO_windows_application" to any location on your hard drive. Enter the subfolder and start the application by opening "Molecular_Biology_of_the_Cell_Ontology.exe".

The subfolder "MBCO_windows_application" also contains <b><i><u>MBCO version 1.1</u></i></b> (that contains a reference for each pathway-gene association and was uploaded in February 2022).<br>

<b><i><u>The last update of the application was uploaded on December 5th, 2022.</u></i></b>

# Additional MBCO datasets
This folder contains two ontologies that map genes to metabolic energy pathways as well as to pathways involved in sodium and glucose transmembrane transport. They were both developed within the Kidney Precision Medicine Project (Hansen, Sealfon, Menon et al, Sci Adv. 2022).

#
The folders "MBCO_enrichment" and "MBCO_dataset" contain a C#-script and datasets that were uploaded in 2017. Both folders have no relevance for the windows application and can simply be ignored.
