<b><i><u>The last update of the application was uploaded on October 06, 2024.</u></i></b><br>
<br>
To use the application, download the zip-folder by pressing the green 'Code'-button on the upper right side of this GitHub internet page. After unpacking of the downloaded folder, copy its subfolder "MBCO_windows_application" to your hard drive.<br>
<br>
## <b>Windows</b><br>
The windows application can be started by opening "Molecular_Biology_of_the_Cell_Ontology.exe".<br>
<br>
## <b>Linux</b><br>
To start the Linux application, download the 'mono-xsp4' or 'mono-devel' package from 'mono-project.com' ("an open source implementation of Microsoft's .NET Framework","sponsored by Microsoft"). Open the application from the terminal with the command "mono Molecular_Biology_of_the_Cell_Ontology.exe".<br>
Briefly, the following commands can be used:<br>
<br>
sudo apt update<br>
sudo apt install mono-xsp4<br>
cd your_directory\MBCO_windows_application<br>
mono Molecular_Biology_of_the_Cell_Ontology.exe<br>
<br>

Additional MBCO datasets
This folder contains two ontologies that map genes to metabolic energy pathways as well as to pathways involved in sodium and glucose transmembrane transport. They were both developed within the Kidney Precision Medicine Project (Hansen, Sealfon, Menon et al, Sci Adv. 2022).
#
The folders "MBCO_enrichment" and "MBCO_dataset" contain a C#-script and datasets that were uploaded in 2017. Both folders have no relevance for the windows application and can simply be ignored.
