The Supplementary Tables were uploaded after publication of the MBCO manuscript in 2017.

MBCO version 1.1 contains a reference for each pathway-gene association and is used by the windows and linux application.
It was originally uploaded as part of the "MBCO_windows_application" folder in February 2022 and was added to this folder for completeness reasons.
For consistency, we labeled the hierarchy and infered relationship files with MBCO_v1.1 as well.
