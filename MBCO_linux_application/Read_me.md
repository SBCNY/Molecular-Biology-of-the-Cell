The MBCO linux application depends on packages supplied by the MONO environment. Mono is an open source project and a compiled version can be downloaded from https://www.mono-project.com/. The package that is needed is "mono-xsp4". After installing mono, open the MBCO_linux_application_directory in the linux terminal and start the application with the command 'mono Molecular_Biology_of_the_Cell_Ontology.exe'.

To use Gene Ontology in the appliation, please download "go-basic.obo" from "http://geneontology.org/docs/download-ontology/" and "goa_human.gaf" from "http://current.geneontology.org/products/pages/downloads.html" and copy both files into the "GO_datasets" folder.
