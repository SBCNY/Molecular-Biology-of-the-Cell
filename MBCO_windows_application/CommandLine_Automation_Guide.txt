For fully automated analysis, the application can be launched from the command line
using the command MBC_PathNet.exe followed by space-delimited arguments. This initiates
the application, automatically performs the Clear, read & analyze function, and then
exits upon successful completion. The application window will remain invisible or may
briefly appear before hiding again. If any errors are encountered during execution,
the window will remain visible to facilitate error inspection.

The input data directory has to be specified using the '--input-dir' argument
(e.g., 'MBC_PathNet.exe --input-dir "D:/My_data_folder/"').
All found compatible data, background gene files and the parameter settings file in
the specified directory will be uploaded automatically.

To define analysis parameters, edit the 'MBC_pathNet_parameter_settings.txt' file.
This file is generated after each run and saved in the 'Input_data' subdirectory
within the results folder. An example file can also be found within the main folder.
Users can set parameters via the application and then copy the resulting file into
the input directory for reuse. All parameters, including the specified results directory,
will be automatically loaded. To quickly generate that file, enter one gene (e.g., AAK1)
into the 'Gene list'-text box, press 'Add dataset' and 'Analyze'. The script will write
that file into the 'Input_data'-subdirectory within the specified results directory 
('Save results in'). If anticipated, parameter settings can be adjusted before analyzing
the data.

The addition of arguments specifying an ontology, a species and the results directory
will override any of those parameters given in the parameter settings file. This simplifies
external variation of those parameters by launching the application multiple times using
different arguments. For example, this can allow to analyze the same data with different
ontologies without editing the 'MBC_pathNet_parameter_settings.txt' file. Enrichment
parameters for each ontology are specified separately for each ontology within the parameter
settings file.
The available arguments are: '--ontology', '--species' and '--results-dir'. They need
to be followed by space and the selection (case-insensitive):
ontolgies: 'MBCO','GO_BP','GO_MF','GO_CC','Reactome', 'Custom_1','Custom_2' (e.g. '--ontology Mbco')
organisms: 'human', 'mouse', 'rat', 'chicken', 'dog', 'pig', 'cow', 'zebrafish', 'frog',
           'c_elegans' or 'fly' (e.g. '--organism fly')
results directory: e.g. '--results-dir D:/MBCO_windows_application/Results/My_results/'

To select preselected column names, just add '--' followed by the name of the selected
button (spaces need to be replaced by underlines): '--MBCO-column-names', '--single-cell-column-names',
'--minimum-column-names' or '--optimum-column-names'.

In addition, user-defined column names can be imported from the input data directory:
'--custom-1-column-names': Loads column names from Custom_1_columnNames_userData.txt
'--custom-2-column-names': Loads column names from Custom_2_columnNames_userData.txt

Only one column name set can be specified at a time.

To generate a template for the specification of custom column names, use the 'Read data'-
menu, select 'Custom 1'- or 'Custom 2'-default column names and upload any dataset.
This can be quickly achieved by uploading the example dataset 'Neurite outgroth' using
the 'Example data'-menu. Afterwards the 'Read data'-menu can be opened, followed by 
selection of the 'Custom 2'-column names and pressing the 'Read'-button. Upon successful
data upload, the application will save the specified 'Custom 2'-column names in the file
'Custom_2_columnNames_userData.txt' in the 'Datasets_generated_by_app'-directory. This
file can be copied into the input data directory, with or without external modification
of the 'Column name in user data' column. Dataset attributes with empty entries in the
'Column name in user data' will be ignored.
Ensure that there are always exactly 2 columns in the tab-delimited custom name file.
Even an empty entry (i.e. a string of length 0) in the 'Column name in user data'-field
has to be separated from the entry in the 'Attribute in the application' field by tab.
Every row has to contain exactly one tab.
If no argument specifying which column names to use is provided, the application will
use default or previously selected column names that are saved in the 'Datasets_generated_by_app'
-folder.
Please note that the application will search for those files in the specified input data
directory, when started in command line mode with the argument to upload custom column names,
while it will search for those files in the 'Datasets_generated_by_app' directory,
when started regularly.

If at least one dataset file was uploaded successfully, the application will proceed to analysis.
Any errors during the upload of any files are exported to the 'Command_line_error_reports.txt'
file that is written into the 'Datasets_generated_by_app', the given data input directory and
the selected results directory.
Additionally, the application will become visible and not close, so that the user can explore
errors using its user interface.

After completing an analysis without any encountered errors, the application automatically
closes and generates an 'Analysis_finished.txt'-file in the 'Datasets_generated_by_app'-folder,
the given input directory and the selected results directory. Any of those files can be used by external
wrapper code as a signal to proceed. If errors were encountered, the application will not close,
allowing investigation of those errors.

When a new analysis is initiated (e.g., in command line mode), the application searches for and
deletes all 'Analysis_finished.txt'-files from both directories. If necessary though, the file
that is used as a signal to proceed by an enwrapping program should be deleted externally before
launching the application from the command line.

Available arguments:
--input-dir "my_path": Specifies the directory containing input data, background genes, the parameter settings file 
                       and eventual user-supplied custom column names. This is the only mandatory argument.
                       Use quotation marks, if path name contains space(s).
--custom-1-column-names: Imports column names from 'Custom_1_columnNames_userData.txt' (recommended).
--custom-2-column-names: Imports column names from 'Custom_2_columnNames_userData.txt' (recommended).
--MBCO-column-names: Selects MBCO default column names
--single-cell-column-names: Selects 'Single Cell' default column names
--minimum-column-names: Selects 'Minimum' default column names
--optimum-column-names: Selects 'Optimum' default column names
--ontology my_ontology: Selects and overwrites the next ontology specified in 'MBC_pathNet_parameter_settings.txt'
                 available ontologies: 'MBCO','GO_BP','GO_MF','GO_CC','Reactome', 'Custom_1','Custom_2'
                 (to replace my_ontology, case-insensitive)
--species my_species: Selects and overwrites the next species ('next_organism') specified in 'MBC_pathNet_parameter_settings.txt'
                  available species: 'human', 'mouse', 'rat', 'chicken', 'dog', 'pig', 'cow', 'zebrafish',
                  'frog', 'c_elegans' or 'fly' (to replace my_species, case-insensitive)
--results-dir "my_path": Sets a new results directory that overwrites the results directory specified
                         in 'MBC_pathNet_parameter_settings.txt'.
                         Use quotation marks, if path name contains space(s).
