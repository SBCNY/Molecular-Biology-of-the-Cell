Updates
July 25, 2022
- The menu panel 'Tips' was updated.
- Two rare conditions that interrupted the generation of bardiagrams or SCP networks were fixed.

June 30, 2022
- To quickly assign integration groups or colors in the menu panel ‘Organize Data’ the user can group multiple datasets together based
  on shared characteristics,  such as Up/Down statuses, time points or substrings within their names. It is now possible to define multiple
  substrings by defining multiple substring indexes. The indexes need to be separated by commas. All datasets with the same substrings at the
  indexed positions will be grouped together.
- The script now writes the data submitted to enrichment analysis as multiple files using the file names specified in the column 'Source'. Similarly,
  the lists of experimental background genes are written into that folder as well. To repeat a previous analysis, the user can simply read those
  files using the regular read pipeline in the menu ‘Read data’ (using the ‘MBCO’ column names). The list of background genes can be added using
  the read and assignment pipeline in the menu panel ‘Background genes’. This way the scripts also avoids automatic screening for some columns
  that are part of the saved input data files (e.g., column ‘Source’).
- Any rows in an uploaded data file that contain zeros in the column assigned to the 1st value will be removed right after the upload.
- A dataset in an uploaded file is now defined by the same name, Up/Down status, timepoint and integration group. Consequently, rows with the same
  name, Up/Down status and timepoint combination but different integration groups will be assigned to different datasets.
- Additional buttons will change their color to light blue when pressed. Color will be set back to dark blue, once the requested action is finished.

June 19, 2022
- The pipeline now allows analysis of datasets with the same name, Up/Down status and timepoint, as long as they are assigned to different
  integration groups.
- The menu panel ‘Tips’ was introduced.
- If a file that assigns multiple integration groups or colors to the same dataset (as defined by a unique dataset name, Up/Down status and
  timepoint combination) is uploaded, the script will warn the user with an error message and ignore the upload (instead of throwing an 
  exception during an internal correctness check). A similar warning already exists, if the same dataset contains the same gene symbol
  multiple times.
- The menu panel ‘SCP networks’ was updated.
- The output within the file ‘Selected_parameter’ was updated.
- If an uploaded dataset file contains only zero values within the column that is assigned to the 1st Value in the ‘Read data’ menu, the 
  script will warn the user with an error message and ignore the upload.
- If no column name is specified for the 1st values, all 1st values in the uploaded data files will be set to 1.
- If MBCO dataset files are missing or corrupted, the script will ask the user to download the MBCO application again.

June 11, 2022
- The new check box 'Connect all related SCPs' under ‘Dynamic enrichment analysis’ in the menu panel 'SCP-networks' allows the user to 
  specify visualized SCP-connections in the networks derived from dynamic enrichment analysis. Unchecked, only those SCPs will be connected 
  that were combined to form a context-specific higher level-SCP that meets the significance criteria, defined in the menu panel 
  ‘Enrichment’. These combined SCPs label the same bar in the bardiagram charts for dynamic enrichment analysis. The results text file that
  documents the significant predictions for dynamic enrichment analysis, lists these SCPs as one entry in the column ‘SCP’, separated by 
  dollar signs. Since an SCP can be part of multiple higher-level SCPs, it can be connected to more than two other SCPs. If the check box 
  is checked, any SCPs will be connected, as long as their interaction is among the top percentages of considered SCP interactions, no 
  matter if they are part of the same significant context-specific higher level-SCP or not. If checked, SCPs will also be connected across 
  different datasets. The top percentages of considered SCP interactions are the same as those used for the dynamic enrichment analysis 
  algorithm and can be modified in the menu panel ‘Enrichment’. 

June 08, 2022
- Any user input for an enrichment, data significance or network parameter that lies outside of the available parameter ranges (e.g., a 
  maximum p-value > 1) will change the text box color to orchid, indicating that those entries will be ignored.
- The text boxes labeled "Top % of SCP interactions for dynamic enrichment analysis" in the menu panel 'Enrichment' allow optimization of 
  the dynamic enrichment algorithm. Changing these values will update the background infered SCP-networks for the next analysis that form 
  the basis of the dynamic enrichment algorithm.

May 15, 2022
- The dataset ‘KPMP reference tissue atlas’ was added as a new example dataset.
