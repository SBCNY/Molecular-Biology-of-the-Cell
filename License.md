License for additional MBCO datasets ("Mbco_na_glucsose_tm_transport_human" in the MBCO application)<br/>
The additional MBCO datasets "Metabolic_energy_generation_pathways_human.txt", "NaAndGluTMTransport_scpGeneAssociations.txt", "NaAndGluTMTransport_scpHierarchy.txt" and "Sphingolipid_metabolism.txt" were generated by Jens hansen working for the Ravi Iyengar Lab and the Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP). The "NaAndGluTMTransport-" files are part of the application where they can be accessed under the name "Mbco_na_glucsose_tm_transport_human".
The copyright holder for these datasets is the author/funder.
They are made available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 Unported License (CC BY 4.0) International liscence.

To generate the dataset "NaAndGluTMTransport_scpGeneAssociations.txt" we started by extracting sodium and glucose transport related genes from the MBCO datasets, Wikipedia articles, peer-reviewed articles and Gene Ontology Biological Processes and Molecular Functions. See the methods section of Hansen, Sealfon, Menon et al. for details. Gene Ontology datasets were made available under a the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 Unported License (http://geneontology.org/docs/go-citation-policy/#:~:text=Gene%20Ontology%20Consortium%20data%20and%20data%20products%20are,Creative%20Commons%20FAQ%20or%20contact%20the%20GO%20Helpdesk.), as on 2022 March 25..
